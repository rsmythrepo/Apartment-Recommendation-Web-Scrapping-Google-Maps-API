The town that has it all

Historically a leisure destination, the recent regeneration and planned arrival of a new Westfield means that Croydon has been put back on the map. Today it is a thriving mix of the new and the old, where one of London's oldest street markets rubs shoulders with the 7 days a week food court at Boxpark, and the independent boutique stores of Croydon Old Town live alongside big brand high street shopping. If you are looking for culture then you're spoilt for choice. Expect independent theatre pubs, art cafes, live music, museums and even a board game cafe bar. And if you're looking for the perfect picnic spot you can wander through the Wandle, a 21-acre park complete with a river, bandstand and ornamental garden.

120 sq m","This fabulous architect-designed contemporary two bedroom townhouse at the northwest corner of London Fields has views across the park and a large private courtyard.

Set over three storeys, the property has two large split level living spaces, an open-plan living room and kitchen/dining room on the ground floor, and a second living room directly above on the first floor. These spaces are connected by a central open light well which lets light into the lower space.

The ground floor open-plan living space comprises a front living room with full-height glazed windows and bespoke storage cupboards (also ideal as a workspace) and, up a few steps, a large L-shaped kitchen/dining area. This room has a smart linear kitchen of fitted wall and floor units with integrated appliances, an atmospheric dining area with large glazed sliding doors which open over the courtyard below, and a door to a decked balcony with space for outdoor eating which also overlooks the courtyard. There’s also a walk-in pantry – a luxury in any kitchen! And a WC accessed via the first floor landing.  

The second living room on the first floor is almost 24 ft long, with windows on three sides and bifold doors onto a balcony that has lovely views of the lido and the park. The smaller rear section of the room is slightly raised and has three picture windows with built-in seating. This intimate space could be used as a guest room, as a door in the corner leads to a shower room with a large walk-in double shower.
 
The courtyard is the focal point of the lower ground floor. With glazed walls on three sides and a high wall on the fourth, including two sets of double doors from each of the bedrooms, this cool central outdoor space is a tranquil oasis, perfectly secure and ideal for letting the fresh air in during hot summer days and nights. The two double bedrooms wrap around this central outdoor space. The slightly larger room has space for a study or dressing area and is adjacent to the bathroom, which has a contemporary suite that includes a bath. The other double room has an en suite shower room and built-in storage.

The house has a street entrance and an adjacent built-in external bin store. The lower ground floor hallway has space for cycle parking. The property is well-insulated and energy-efficient, with an EPC B rating. It has two solar panels, so occupiers can potentially sell any excess energy to their electricity supplier.

London Fields West Side is a development of just two townhouses by award-winning architects Chance de Siva, who have a track record of creating beautiful one-off properties which respond to and enhance their surroundings. Located in a prime position opposite the lido and the northwest corner of the fields, this development has multiple internal levels different levels and a variety of window treatments that provide views of the fields and whimsical glimpses of the surrounding neighbourhood. The interiors mix industrial and modern materials with a muted pastel palette to create an ambience that is both cutting-edge contemporary and comfortable.
