The town that has it all

Historically a leisure destination, the recent regeneration and planned arrival of a new Westfield means that Croydon has been put back on the map. Today it is a thriving mix of the new and the old, where one of London's oldest street markets rubs shoulders with the 7 days a week food court at Boxpark, and the independent boutique stores of Croydon Old Town live alongside big brand high street shopping. If you are looking for culture then you're spoilt for choice. Expect independent theatre pubs, art cafes, live music, museums and even a board game cafe bar. And if you're looking for the perfect picnic spot you can wander through the Wandle, a 21-acre park complete with a river, bandstand and ornamental garden.
